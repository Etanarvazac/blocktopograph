## ![update](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/blob/master/svg/update.svg) Updates
This project is quite old and hopefully can be updated to the current versions of Android and MCPE.
**To Do:**
1. Gain access to the new world save location. (/Android/Data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang)
2. Update Map to read 1.18+ worlds.
3. Update NBT editor to account for 1.18 values.

## Translations/Pull Requests
Until 1.18 is supported and on Android 12+, translations are put on hold. Pull requests are accepted if it is deemed to help accomplish the goals outlined above.

## ![build](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/blob/master/svg/hammer-wrench.svg) Build your own version
**Android Studio:**
1. Clone project: `File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git`
2. Install the missing SDK components (which Android Studio should give you the Auto-Fix options).

**Your Android Device:**
1. Fork this project from your web browser (make sure "Desktop Site" is enabled)
2. Create a Persional Access Token on GitHub `Tap picture -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal Access Token` (You will need to copy the key you are given. You'll only see it once at the the time of creation.)
3. Download Acode from Google Play. [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foxdebug.acode)
4. Tap on 3 dots in top-right and then on GitHub. This is where you need to provide the key copied from step 2.
5. Upon completion, anytime you tap on that menu option, your GitHub profile should be displayed. You now only need to navigate to your fork (repo) of this project. Saving any opened file in Acode will automatically commit the change in GitHub.

## Release-Workflow
The original Google Play version was managed by [@MithrilMania](https://github.com/MithrilMania) which means the release-signing keys are NOT available. You would need to build it as a debug version or sign it with your own keys. There is no guarentee that version will be updated. However, there is a chance that any significant and well-written feature additions or fixes will make it into that build.
