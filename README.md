## Updates coming (hopefully)
As title, with luck I would be able to grt this working with Android 12+ and MCPE 1.18+.
**To Do:**
1. Gain access to the new world save location. (/Android/Data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang)
2. Update Map to read 1.18+ worlds.
3. Update NBT editor to account for 1.18 values.

## Translations/Pull Requests
Until 1.18 is supported and on Android 12+, translations are put on hold. Pull requests are accepted if it is deemed to help accomplish the goals outlined above.

## ![build](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/blob/master/icons/svg/camera-front-variant.svg)Build

Clone project in Android Studio: `File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git`  
Install missing SDK components. Android Studio would give you the auto-fix options.  

### Release-Workflow

The official Google-Play version is managed by @mithrilmania. The Release-signing keys are not available.
You can build it as debug build or sign it with your own keys.

This Google-Play version will be updated after any significant and well-written feature additions and fixes.
